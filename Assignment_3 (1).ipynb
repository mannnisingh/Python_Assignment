        "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans.Functions are advantageous to have in programs for several reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Modularity**: Functions allow you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces. Each function can encapsulate a specific task or set of tasks, making the code easier to understand, debug, and maintain. This modularity also promotes code reusability, as functions can be called multiple times throughout the program or in different programs altogether.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction**: Functions provide a level of abstraction by hiding the implementation details of a particular task. This allows you to focus on the higher-level logic of your program without getting bogged down in the nitty-gritty details of how individual tasks are performed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Readability**: Well-named functions can serve as a form of documentation, making the code more readable and understandable to other developers (including your future self). By giving descriptive names to functions, you can convey their purpose and functionality at a glance.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Code Organization**: Functions help organize your code into logical units, making it easier to navigate and maintain. This organization becomes especially important as programs grow larger and more complex.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Testing and Debugging**: Functions make it easier to test and debug your code. Since each function performs a specific task, you can isolate and test individual pieces of functionality independently. This makes it easier to identify and fix bugs, as well as verify that each function behaves as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Scalability**: Using functions allows you to scale your code more easily. As your program grows in size and complexity, you can add new functions to handle additional functionality without having to rewrite existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, functions are a fundamental building block of programming that promote code reuse, readability, maintainability, and scalability."

        "\n",
        "Ans.The code within a function runs when the function is called, not when it is specified.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you define a function in your code, you're essentially creating a reusable block of code that will execute when the function is invoked or called. Until the function is called, the code inside it remains dormant. Once the function is called, the program jumps to the function's definition and executes the code within it, following the flow of execution specified by the function's logic.\n",

        "In this example, \"Before calling the function\" is printed first, followed by the function call `my_function()`, which then prints \"This is inside my_function\". Finally, \"After calling the function\" is printed. This demonstrates that the code inside the function runs when the function is called, not when it is defined."

        "- `(parameters)`: These are the input parameters or arguments that the function takes. They are optional. If the function doesn't take any parameters, you still need to include empty parentheses.\n",
        "- `\"\"\"Optional docstring describing the function.\"\"\"`: This is an optional docstring (documentation string) that provides a description of the function's purpose, usage, and other details. It's good practice to include docstrings to document your functions.\n",

        "Ans.The `try` clause in Python is used to enclose the code that you anticipate might raise an exception or encounter an error during its execution. The purpose of the `try` clause is to \"try\" executing the code within its block. If an error occurs while executing the code inside the `try` block, Python will stop executing that block and jump to the corresponding `except` block (if one exists). Essentially, the `try` block is where you specify the code that might potentially raise an exception.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `except` clause, on the other hand, is used to define the code that should be executed if a particular type of exception occurs within the associated `try` block. The purpose of the `except` clause is to handle or catch exceptions that occur during the execution of the code in the `try` block. You can have multiple `except` clauses to handle different types of exceptions, allowing you to provide custom error handling routines based on the specific type of error encountered.\n",
